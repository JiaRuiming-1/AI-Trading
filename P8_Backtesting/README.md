## Project Instrcution
In this project wo practice last step of quant research. The project well implements all steps what I learned from make up factor to backtesting.

## Example Demo
This project contains some python package to use. Some simple example of utilizing below:
`lbfgs_test.ipynb` is a example of scipy.optimize.fmin_l_bfgs_b using which is a convex optimization method run faster than cvxpy
